//For example, you have a function to deduct monthly club fees
function getMontlhlyFee(fee){
  var remaining = this.total - fee;
  this.total = remaining;
  return;
}

//Now you want to reuse this function for different club member. Note that monthly fee will vary from member to member.

//Let's Rachel has a balance of 500 and monthly membership fee is 90.
var rachel = {name:'Rachel Green', total:500};

//Now, create a function that can be used again and again to take out fee from her account every month

//bind
var getRachelFee = getMontlhlyFee.bind(rachel, 90);
//deduct
getRachelFee();//Rachel Green remaining balance:410
getRachelFee();//Rachel Green remaining balance:320

//Now same getMonthlyFee function could be used for another member with different membership fee. For Example, Ross Geller has 250 balance and monthly fee 25
var ross = {name:'Ross Geller', total:250};
//bind
var getRossFee = getMontlhlyFee.bind(ross, 25);
//deduct
getRossFee(); //Ross Geller remaining balance:225
getRossFee(); //Ross Geller remaining balance:200
